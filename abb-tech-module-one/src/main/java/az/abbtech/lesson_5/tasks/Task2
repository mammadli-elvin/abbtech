TODO:
    Enum: CoffeeSize
        Create an enum called CoffeeSize that has three sizes:
            SMALL with a price of $2.5
            MEDIUM with a price of $3.5
            LARGE with a price of $4.5
        Add a field price to store the price for each size.
        Include a method double getPrice() to return the price of the coffee size.
    Enum: CoffeeType
        Create an enum called CoffeeType with options:
            ESPRESSO
            LATTE
            CAPPUCCINO
        Add a method String getDescription() that returns a description for each type:
            ESPRESSO - "A strong coffee shot."
            LATTE - "A smooth coffee with milk."
            CAPPUCCINO - "A rich and foamy coffee."
    Class: CoffeeOrder
        Create a class called CoffeeOrder that contains:
            private CoffeeType type - The type of coffee.
            private CoffeeSize size - The size of the coffee.
        Add a constructor to initialize type and size.
        Add a method void printOrderDetails() that:
            Prints the coffee type, description, size, and price.
        Add a method double calculateTotal() that:
            Returns the total cost of the coffee.
    Create Coffee Orders:
        Instantiate CoffeeOrder objects with different CoffeeType and CoffeeSize combinations to simulate different customer orders.
        Display Order Details:
            Call the printOrderDetails() method on each CoffeeOrder object to display the details of the order (type, description, size, and price).
            Use calculateTotal() to get the total price for the coffee and display it.
    NOTE:
        There was no point in using total and it was equal to price in any time.
        That's why I create int count field in CoffeeOrder class.
