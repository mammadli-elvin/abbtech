TODO:
    Requirements:
    Abstract Class: Vehicle
        Create an abstract class called Vehicle.
    Add the following fields:
        protected String brand - The brand of the vehicle.
        protected int year - The manufacturing year of the vehicle.
    Add a constructor to initialize the fields.
    Add the following abstract methods:
        void startEngine() - Method to start the vehicleâ€™s engine.
        void move() - Method for how the vehicle moves.
    Concrete Classes:
        Car and Bicycle
    Create a class Car that extends Vehicle:
        Implement startEngine() to print "The car's engine roars to life!".
        Implement move() to print "The car drives down the road.".
    Create a class Bicycle that also extends Vehicle:
        Implement startEngine() to print "Bicycles don't have engines!".
        Implement move() to print "The bicycle pedals along the path.".
    Create the Main Class:
        Define a Main class with the public static void main(String[] args) method.
        Instantiate Vehicle Objects:
            Create objects of Car and Bicycle using their constructors with appropriate values for brand and year.
                Example: Create a Car object with the brand "Toyota" and year 2020.
                Example: Create a Bicycle object with the brand "Giant" and year 2018.
        Invoke Methods:
            Call the startEngine() method on each object to see how each vehicle starts.
            Call the move() method to see how each vehicle moves.
        Display Output:
            Print a blank line between each vehicle's output to keep things clear.
