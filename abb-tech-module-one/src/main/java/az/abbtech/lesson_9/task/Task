TODO:
    Student Grade Management
    You are required to create a program to manage students and their grades using Java. The program should allow:
        1. Storing student data:
            Use a Map where the key is the student's name (String) and the value is the Student object.
        2. Student Sorting:
            Implement the Comparable interface in the Student class to sort students by their total grades in descending order.
            Create a Comparator to sort students alphabetically by their names.
        3. Displaying Data: Print the students' details sorted by:
            a. Total grades (using the natural order from Comparable).
            b. Name (using the custom Comparator).
    Class Design:
        Student Class:
            Fields: name (String), mathGrade, scienceGrade, and englishGrade (all integers).
            Method: int getTotalGrade() to calculate the total of all grades.
    Requirements:
        1. Implement the Comparable interface for sorting by total grades.
        2. Write a Comparator class for sorting alphabetically.
        3. Use TreeMap or Collections.sort() for displaying sorted data.
