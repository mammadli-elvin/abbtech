    Building a Student and Teacher Management System with a Generic Class
    Design and implement a student and teacher management system using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java.
    Utilize a generic class to store and manage both students and teachers in the system. The system should include the following functionalities:
        Addition:
            Allow the addition of new students and teachers to the system.
        Removal:
            Enable the removal of students and teachers from the system.
        Search:
            Provide the ability to search for students and teachers by their name or ID.
        Display:
            Allow the display of all students and teachers enrolled in the system.
        Uniqueness:
            Ensure that each student and teacher has a unique ID.
        Classes:
            Implement appropriate classes such as Student, Teacher, Manager, etc., with suitable attributes and methods.
        Generic Storage:
            Utilize a generic class to store the students and teachers in the system.
    Your implementation should demonstrate good OOP practices like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    Additionally, consider error handling and input validation to ensure the robustness of your system.
        1.Student and teacher classes should have personal id, name and age elements.
        2.The id should change as each element is added
        3.The GenericStorage class must be a generic class
            The addItem() method should add an item, the removeItem() method should be able to remove an item from the list of items,
            searchItem() should be able to retrieve an item by id, and displayAllItems() should be able to display.
        4.Use an array to count the elements
        5.In the Main class, create GenericStorage and add Students and Teachers to it.
        6.Finally, test the GenericStorage methods
