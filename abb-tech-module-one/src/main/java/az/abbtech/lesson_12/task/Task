TODO:
    Create a Java program that performs basic file operations: reading from a file, appending new data to a file.
    Initial Setup:
        Create a text file named students.txt with the following content:
            101,ARIF,80
        Each line contains a StudentID, Name, and Score separated by commas.
    Task Requirements:
        1. Read the File:
            Write a method that reads all the student records from the students.txt file and displays them in the following format:
        2. Append to the File:
            Write a method to append a new student record to the file.
                For example, appending:
                    102,SARA,75
                After appending:
                    101,ARIF,80
                    102,SARA,75
        3. Error Handling:
            Ensure proper exception handling for cases such as file not found, read/write errors, or invalid data.
    Main Program:
        Create a menu-driven program that allows the user to:
            View all student records.
            Append a new student record.
    EXAMPLE VIEW AFTER RUNNING CODE:
        Menu:
        1. View all records
        2. Overwrite file with new records
        3. Append a new record
        4. Exit
        Enter your choice: 1
        StudentID: 101, Name: ARIF, Score: 80
        StudentID: 102, Name: SARA, Score: 75
