TODO:
    You are tasked with implementing a simple Movie Management System in Java using collections, streams, and lambdas.
    The system should allow users to perform various operations such as adding movies, searching for movies, and displaying the movie inventory.
        1. Movie Class:
            Define a Movie class with attributes:
                title (String)
                director (String)
                genre (String)
                releaseYear (int).
            Implement appropriate constructors and methods to access these attributes.
        2. MovieLibrary Class:
            Create a MovieLibrary class to manage a collection of movies. Use an appropriate collection (e.g., ArrayList) to store movies.
            Implement the following methods:
                1. Add a movie to the library.
                2. Remove a movie from the library.
                3. Search for movies by title, director, or genre.
                4. Display all movies sorted by title, director, or release year.
                5. Calculate the average release year of all movies in the library.
                6. Count the number of movies in the library.
        3. Lambdas and Streams:
            Utilize lambdas and streams wherever applicable for concise and efficient code.
            Use stream operations like filter(), mapToInt(), sorted(), collect(), etc., to perform operations on the movie collection.
        4. Example and Testing:
            Provide an example in the main method to demonstrate the functionalities of the MovieLibrary class.
            Test various functionalities such as adding movies, searching for movies, and displaying the movie inventory to ensure correctness.
