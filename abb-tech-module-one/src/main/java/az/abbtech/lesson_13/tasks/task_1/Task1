TODO:
    Singleton Pattern - Simple Counter
    Objective: Implement a Singleton class that tracks the number of times a method is called.
    Instructions:
        1. Create a class CallTracker that follows the Singleton pattern.
        2. The class should:
            Have a private static instance of itself.
            Provide a public static method to get the instance.
            Have a private constructor.
        3. Add a method increment() that increases a counter and prints the current count.
            CallTracker tracker = CallTracker.getInstance();
            tracker.increment(); // Output: Call count: 1
            tracker.increment(); // Output: Call count: 2
