TODO:
    Design a class called "Counter" to keep track of the number of instances created.
        Implement a static field called "instanceCount" to count the number of objects created from this class.
        Additionally, create a static method called "getInstanceCount()" to return the current count of instances.
        Test this class by creating multiple instances and accessing the instance count.
