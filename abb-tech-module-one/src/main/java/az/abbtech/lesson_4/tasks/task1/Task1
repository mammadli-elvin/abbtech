TODO:
    Product Initialization
    Create a Java class called "Product" with the following components:
        Static Block:
            Create a static block inside the class to initialize a static variable called "companyName" with a default value, such as "MyCompany".
        Non-Static Block:
            Create a non-static block (instance initializer) inside the class to initialize a non-static variable called "productID". Start the product ID from 1000 and increment it by 1 for each new product created.
        Constructor:
            Implement a constructor that takes the product name as an argument.
            Inside the constructor, initialize a non-static variable called "productName" with the provided name.
        Main Class:
            Create a main class called "ProductTest" with a main method.
            Inside the main method, prompt the user to enter the name of a product.
            Instantiate an object of the "Product" class with the provided product name.
            Print out the details of the product, including the company name, product ID, and product name.
