TODO:
    You are tasked with creating a mini library management system. Implement the following functionalities using appropriate Java Collections:
    1. Track Books in the Library:
        Use a List to store the books in the library. Each book should have the following attributes:
            Title (String)
            Author (String)
            ISBN (String)
    2. Track Borrow Requests:
        Use a Queue to handle book borrow requests. Each request should store:
            Borrower Name (String)
            Book ISBN (String)
    3. Track Unique Borrowers:
        Use a Set to store the names of borrowers who have borrowed at least one book.
    Tasks:
        1. Add Books to the Library:
            Create a method addBook(String title, String author, String isbn) to add books to the library's book list.
        2. List All Books:
            Create a method listBooks() to display all the books in the library.
        3. Add Borrow Requests:
            Create a method addBorrowRequest(String borrowerName, String isbn) to add a borrow request to the queue.
        4. Process Borrow Requests:
            Create a method processRequest() that processes the next borrow request in the queue.
                If the book exists in the library, mark it as borrowed (remove from the list).
                Add the borrower's name to the Set of unique borrowers.
        5. List Unique Borrowers:
            Create a method listBorrowers() to display all unique borrowers.
        6. Handle Edge Cases:
            If a borrow request is made for a book that doesnâ€™t exist, display an appropriate message.
            If a borrow request is processed when the queue is empty, display an appropriate message.
